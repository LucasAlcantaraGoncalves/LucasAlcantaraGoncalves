- 👋 Hi, I’m Lucas Alcântara Gonçalves, 🇧🇷, 24yo.
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, both Front and Back end.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JS, React, C#, .Net, ASP.Net and SLQ(Mainly SQLServer and MySQL).
I know it's a lot, but I try my best to organize and keep it concise, I also have plans to start NoSQL and dive into Mobile, but for now I have both hands full.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open source projects also looking for my first job in the industry, I like to help whenever, wherever and however I can, and if it grants me skills, experience along with a way for a living... well, even better 😄.
- 📫 How to reach me ? My e-mail is the easiest way to do it, I will answer you as soon as I can 👍: lucas.alc.gon@gmail.com
