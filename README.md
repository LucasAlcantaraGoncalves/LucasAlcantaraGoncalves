- 👋 Hi, I’m Lucas Alcântara Gonçalves, 🇧🇷, 27yo.
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, both Front and Back end, slowly dabbling into machine learning and data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, .Net, ASP.Net and SLQ(Mainly SQLServer and MySQL), Phyton, Math and Statistics for machine learning and data science.
- 🧪 I know it's a lot, but I try my best to organize and keep it concise.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open source projects also looking for my first job in the industry.
- 💡 I like to help whenever, wherever and however I can, and if it grants me skills, experience along with a way for a living... well, even better 😄.
- 📫 How to reach me ? My e-mail is the easiest way to do it, I will answer you as soon as I can 👍: lucas.alc.gon@gmail.com
